Our project focuses on the accurate analysis of satellite imagery to identify the location of deforestation.
and human encroachment on forests through multi-label image classification. 
We have trained our dataset using different models including Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) based baseline
model, ResNet with Dropout and Resnet with Data Augmentation. After training, we analysed and
compared the performance of our models using F-beta score and Cross Entropy Loss.

The following repository contains both the Python NOtebook and Python files.
The Planet_data.npz file is a compressed mapping of the images with the labels.
